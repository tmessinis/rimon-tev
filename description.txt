The rimon-tev app should create a form for a Google apps user asking them the simple question
of whether they have entered all of their billable time up to this point. The user should then
be able to answer 'yes' or 'no' through two radio options.

The application will then records their answer and present it in table form right below the 
form, stacked above their previous answers. The table will present the 12 most recent answers.
Each row of the table will include the date that the response was recorded, the response, and
if the user is an admin a delete button.

Since this application will be heavily based on the Google apps Python tutorial Guestbook app,
it will utilize a similar structure. There will be a model named 'Answer', a 'MainPage' 
handler, and an 'Attorney' handler. An entity key will be created based on the 'Attorney' 
handler.

The 'Answer' model will model an individual answer entry. It will include the following fields:
    - attorney: This will be pulled from the Google app engine users api.
    - response: This will record the 'yes' or 'no' answer.
    - timestamp: An automatic time stamp will be created that records date and time for sorting
          purposes. Time will be UTC.
    - date: An automatic date record to display with the response in the HTML table.
